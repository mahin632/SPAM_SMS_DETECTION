# 📩 Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning
A machine learning project to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate) using natural language processing and traditional ML classifiers. This project uses TF-IDF vectorization and compares three popular models:
✅ Logistic Regression
✅ Naive Bayes
✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧠 Objective
To build a robust text classification model that can:
1. Automatically detect spam messages.
2. Compare performance across multiple ML algorithms.
3. Visualize model accuracy and confusion matrices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
```bash
Python 3
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Place the dataset file (spam.csv) in the same folder as the script
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
4. Run the model script:
```bash
python spam_sms_detection.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works
1. TF-IDF Vectorization of the text messages

2. Training of 3 classifiers:

  Logistic Regression

  Naive Bayes

  SVM (LinearSVC)

3. Evaluation using:
  Accuracy

  Confusion Matrix

  Classification Report

4. Visualization of:
  Model accuracy comparison (bar chart)

  Confusion matrix heatmaps

5. Prediction of a custom sample SMS message

## 📊 Sample Output
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.982 Naive Bayes Accuracy: 0.965 SVM Accuracy: 0.984

📩 Sample Message: "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 Walmart gift card. Call now!" → Predicted as Spam by all models.
